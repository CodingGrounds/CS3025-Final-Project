This is because of poor budgeting.\n\nMeanwhile, some people manage to live well and save up money despite having little income.

Firstly, you need to think about what things are important to you that cost money.\n\nThis will be different depending on where you are in your life.\n\nExample: Food is important to everyone, but many young people don't have to worry about paying for it."

If food costs you an average of $200-300 per month, then you should put around 300 in your budget. That is not to say you shouldn't try to lower this number, but it is important to have a realistic, high-end estimate, just to be safe."

Example: \"I want to save up $60 to buy a new game next month\" \n\nSome of these goals will be long-term. Example: \"I want to save up $10000 to pay for my first year of university.\""

Emergency expenses and sudden loss of income can ruin a good budget very fast and majorly delay your future goals.\n\nInvesting is another important form of saving that will be covered in depth another time. Because of interest, money you invest grows over time. This can be a great tool to help meet extra-long-term goals, for example, retirement."

Good goals are specific, realistic and time-bounded.\nWhen setting goals for your budget you must also consider which goals are most important. When trying to save money, the least important goals are the ones you want to take money from first.\nAnother consideration for your budget goals is completeness. Budgeting for food isn't the most exciting, but eating foor is very important."
